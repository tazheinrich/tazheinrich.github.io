Presently, I’m a researcher at the Department of Research Methods at the University of Regensburg’s Institute for Political Science, where I’m also pursuing my PhD studies.\nIn my research, I analyze data related to social stratification, public opinion, and voting behavior in Western Europe to investigate how differences in education levels affect people’s value orientations and voting patterns. I enjoy sharing my expertise with others by offering courses and workshops in statistics, statistical programming, and research methods mostly for undergraduate and graduate students.\nIn my spare time, you’ll typically find me playing tennis, hiking, or listing to music."
